### Pre Pull Request checklist:
###### Code style
- [ ] Changes to the code comply with set clang-format rules

###### Testing
- [ ] All tests are passing.
- [ ] I _added new / changed existing_ tests to reflect code changes (state why not otherwise!)
- [ ] I tested my changes manually (Describe how, to what extent etc.)
- [ ] I run the code under Valgrind and have no memory leeks, memory access violations. ***(Can we do that?)***

###### Commit Messages
- [ ] Commit message is saying what has been changed, **why** it was changed? Remember other developers might not know 
  what the problem you are fixing was. Note also negative _decision_ (e.g., why did you not do particular thing) 
  **TLDR: Commit message are comprehensive**
